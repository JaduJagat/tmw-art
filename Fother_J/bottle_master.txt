Post subject: Bottles

Meway and I were working on a variety of bottles over on TMW, and
the discussion of different bottled items came up for use in a
bottle system... So I had made a few random bottled items:

Image Full Liquid (dyeable)
Image Half Liquid (dyeable)
Image Bottled Whisp/Wisp (dyeable)
Image Bottled Slime (dyeable)
Image Bottled Pinkie
Image Bottled Maggot
Image Bottled Jack-O Soul

I figured you all might have some need for bottled items too, so
here's an archive containing the layered XCF file for making
bottled items, plus all of the previous bottled items i put
together.

  * !Face Glass is the top layer. Place any items below it.
  * !Base should be the bottom layer.
  * @Stencil is just a training layer so you don't draw
    the contained item outside of the glass.
